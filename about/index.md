{{ site.description }}

graphics for this site use an excellent [javascript delaunay triangulation tool](https://github.com/msurguy/triangles) processed with [p5 dithering algorithms](https://github.com/dpiccone/dithering_algorithms) and [processing 3](https://processing.org/), and further refined with [gimp](http://www.gimp.org/). image glitching is hand-crafted with [hexfiend](http://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/) and [audacity](http://audacityteam.org/).

this site was built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and based on the [hpstr](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme) theme.
