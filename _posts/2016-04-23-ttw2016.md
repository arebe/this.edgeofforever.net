the utopia has become overgrown
======

welcome to [theorizing the web](http://theorizingtheweb.tumblr.com/), in which rooms full of  people with beautifully diverse and itnerdiscipllinary backgrounds have the pleasure of taking a weekend to converse with each other about the internet.

what brought me to this conference? as a non-academic, i was not presenting my research, nor was i interested particularly in professional networking. my interest lies in hearing the thoughts of people who take the internet seriously - even more seriously than i do - and not due to marketing conversion rates or bottom lines. our online interactions mediate so much of our lives, it seems only fitting to give it the thoughfulness that it deserves. i came for inspriration and grounding for my own professional and artistic practices and i found plenty of both.

legitmization via authenticity
======

online, as in the rest of life, certain elements become mainstream, or brought into _canon_ - a term most used in the fan fiction world but with broad reaching cultural implications. the development of _taste_ reflects contemporary values of what is considered pleasing, enjoyable, and (more recently) authentic. it is a zero-sum game, with the latest trends being inevitably being judged by their predessecors and re-inventing the bounds of taste and authenticity. the new is more authentic, the mainstream is most tasteful.


how's our performance?
======

#ttw2016 calls no one to action. as the scientific method begins with observation, it follows that theories must develop before we discover the best ways forward. the subtext - what kind of web do we wish to inhabit?  - meets with realism and the explication of experience.

after the conference, i am left to examine my own performance. what pop culture am i canonizing through social media shares? what social priviledges do my own selfies (or lack thereof) evoke?

and then...there were bots
======

the most intriguing thought that i encountered at #ttw2016 originated during the 'automated personality' keynote panel, while judith donath spoke of artificial intelligence and biological signaling. she notes that the turing test is the turning point beyond which we can no longer reliably judge ai, as at that point they have become like non-poisonous viceroy butterflies mimicing the signals of their deadlier relatives. i wondered, will the processes of natural selection work on these entities as well? what will their accelrated selective pressures optimize them for? and will we ever be able to comprehend?

we craft the web, whether it's eating itself, or we're eating whoppers. it is impossible to do so without bias. #ttw2016 sheds light on how these biases manifest, through focusing on vernacular use of web platforms.

the biggest take away from an industry perspective is that people will find ways to use the web and play out the drama of sociality unexpectedly. "the user is not you" becomes a poigant directive - wee must build systems with enough flexibilty that allows, and even encourages end-user innovations.  modularity, openness, and remixability are the currency in online pop culture.
