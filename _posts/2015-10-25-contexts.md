what are we trying to accomplish, leaving the city behind, watching the lights recede into the sacred dark of nature.

what is natural. what did we discuss. living the high life on the edge of apocalypse we feed each other information and satisfy primordial desires.

yet we all agree, things fall apart.

yet when have they not. 

the orbit of the earth is a slow process of falling into the sun, and missing.

we share what we can, word salads. 

i spent two days without technology, chatting about technology. i am a cyborg.

so the environment grows up around us, and we tend it and prune it to our liking. or let it grow. the blossoming colors of the gowanus canal speak loudly of our uniquely suited abilities to appreciate our anthropocene context.

living on the brink of a new world, do we stop to ponder too often where we've come and spend less time appreciating where we're going?
