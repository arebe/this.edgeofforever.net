today's idea for #post_human fashion: 

puzzlewear.

shirts with subtle geometric patterns that might entertain fellow metro-travelers with spatial puzzles to solve.

sounds like:  [bees and bombs](http://beesandbombs.tumblr.com/) manifested on a screen print.

fashion for social good. post_human performative social gifting.
