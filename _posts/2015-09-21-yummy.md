a few weeks ago i was surfing around the interwebs and decided to check in on [yummy international](http://www.yummyinternational.com/), the food blog of the traveling post_human chef jerica green. always eager to learn more ways to sustain my meat-space existence, i was intrigued by her cooking tips, and enjoyed re-learning [how to hold a chef knife](http://www.yummyinternational.com/2015/06/cooking-tip-8-how-to-properly-hold-chef.html]).

then i surfed onward, and for all intents and purposes, forgot what i had read.

time passed, life moved on, i read more cool articles about countless other things that i have similarly submerged in my sea of thoughts in the wake of the living present instant.

but today, i started to chop garlic and noticed that i was using the technique without conscious effort, without ruminating over the blog post in the intervening time.

i'm not sure what it was about this meme in particular that took root in my barely-conscious layers. was it the first-person photos? was it because i had encountered the information before? some confluence of events have lead to a real change in my behavior - muscle-memory practically - without conscious effort.

post_human props to jerica, for hacking my brain so effectively, with such useful information :)
