post_humans prefer to organize procrastination as intricate cascading tasks of increasing complexity.

hi new york. i've been here for about two weeks, lying low and getting a feel for the landscapes.

tomorrow is the much-anticipated [internet yami-ichi nyc](http://yami-ichi.biz/nyc/). i'll be there, as an ex-pat member of the [weather is happening](http://weatherishappening.com/) weather team. so [#weatherpunk](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23weatherpunk).

i have much to share with you, and even more as the timewave collapses to zero. 

as ever,

RB
