seeing an estimated 12+ miles to your destination can be discouraging. the raw number belies the invigoration of biking the urban jungle.

gradients of people rush by to the sound of wind. traffic patterns emerge, merge, submerge, but staying afloat is easy as keeping toes on the pedals and pushing.

what more could be desired from this sacred union with the city infrastructure? 

minimal minimap.

soundtrack.

image capture.

chroma-expressiveness.

handsfree pov.
